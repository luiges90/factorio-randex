pw-rand-recipe-difficulty=Higher values means recipes are more expensive. Required ingredients are multiplied by this value.
pw-rand-enemy-health=Higher values means enemies are more tough. Their health are multiplied by this value.
pw-rand-recipe-prescale=Scale all recipe quantities and time with this value. Since recipe are of integral amounts, scaling all quantities before randomization allows for more varied values. Recipe time is also scaled by this factor to keep all production same.
